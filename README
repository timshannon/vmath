All operations will be typed methods which apply to the owner of the method.

//Multiplies against self
func (m *Matrix3) M3MulSelf(other *Matrix3) {
 ...
}

//Multiplies the two matrices and applies to self
func (m *Matrix3) M3Mul(m1, m2 *Matrix3) {
 ...
}

matrix.M3Mul(m1, m2)
matrix.M3MulSelf(m1)
This should allow the programmer to reuse a lot of variables and cut down on garbage.

Note that on XXXSelf() methods, temp variables may need to be created to safely do the operation, so the quickest and least garbage creating option will always be the operations that aren't labeled "self", however passing the pointer to an object for a parameter that is the same as the calling object may result in incorrect calculations.
